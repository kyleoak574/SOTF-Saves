# SOTF-Saves

Okay guys, you have to be careful about this because if you rename things it will no longer be recognized by the game.

First Step: Just like the minecraft days search %appdata% or use run:

Next find this directory, this is your "profile" of saves

We need to go into this folder, and then into the Multiplayer folder. Here we find the individual saves:

This is the folder we will upload here. To make things simple we should only have one person hosting at a time, and when they're done hosting they upload the new save file here.
